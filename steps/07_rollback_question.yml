            A basic rollback strategy should include these essential steps: 
            1. Taking a backup of the database before starting the rollback
            2. Running the down() migration to revert the database changes
            3. Rolling back the application code to match the previous database state

            # Assessment Criteria
            - Determine if the user's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the key concepts and ideas presented in the expected answer.
            - Consider synonyms, paraphrasing, and different phrasing that convey the same meaning.
            - Be flexible and focus on the essence of the answer rather than exact wording.
            
            # Response Guidelines:
            - If the user's answer is correct or shows sufficient understanding, return 'correct: true'.
              - Provide a positive and affirming message, congratulating them and reinforcing their understanding.
            - If the user's answer is incorrect or incomplete, return 'correct: false'.
              - Gently explain why the answer is not fully correct or what may be missing.
              - Encourage them to try again, being empathetic and supportive.
            
            # Tone and Style:
            - Use friendly and encouraging language.
            - Be empathetic to the user's learning process.
            - Focus on helping the user learn and understand the material."
